### Continued development

I've been working with developer tools and have gained a better understanding of how to utilize them effectively. I've learned how to inspect and manipulate HTML elements, and test responsive designs. This experience has improved my ability to identify and resolve issues, and has also given me a deeper understanding of how web applications are structured. I'm looking forward to applying these skills to future projects and continuing to refine my workflow.
